                    This work operates at the border between fashion and performance, with the intention to explore the
                    performativity of
                    body in relation to forms of dress. The collection is developed by designing new activities of
                    getting
                    dressed, in order
                    to create new forms and expressions in dress. Therefore the acts of spinning and crawling have been
                    explored as ways of
                    getting dressed. By approaching settings of material with the different acts, the established orders
                    within dress has
                    been shifted, with dress that is developed by the movement of body rather than mimicing a bodily
                    shape.

                    The work is not about dance, it is not about theatre, it is not about choreography. This work is
                    about
                    the activity of
                    getting dressed and what potential knowledge in dress that may be extracted from simply shifting the
                    established order
                    of the relationship between body and dress. However, from a methodological point of view, the work
                    is
                    developed through
                    choreography and performance in relation to arranged space as tools to design the activities, and
                    these
                    may well be
                    viewed as a danced or theatrical and dramaturgi- cal play of body, motion, material and dress.
                    These aspects are part of the outcome that suggests not only new formal relationships between body
                    and
                    dress and new
                    methods for making dress, but also new ways of look- ing at, and consuming the art of dress.
